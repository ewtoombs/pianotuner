### Dec 20, 2015

I started a rudimentary, software-only piano tuner experiment.

### Dec 21, 2015

Abandoned the software experiment.

### July 4, 2019

I hack together some notes for a possible hardware implementation of a piano
tuner, thinking about:

- Needles for octave, note in octave, tuning in note, volume
- Lamp for power
- Lamps behind needle dials
- Capacitive fade-in for lamps
- Glass or plastic bead in front of power lamp
- Phonograph-style mic pickup
- Clock hands for needles

Initially I assume it'll run a Fast Fourier Transform, and toy with the idea
of using a 
[Texas Instruments LEA](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa720/slaa720.pdf)
(Low-Energy Accelerator). That would be good if we're making 10,000 of these
things, but it would be a steep learning curve.

All of this goes into a Google Doc and then somewhat forgotten about.

### Sept 26, 2020

I found an antique-style wooden box on Facebook Marketplace. It's pretty
clearly one-of-a-kind, and was hand-made in an Egyptian workshop by a late 
relative of the seller. It's perfect.

In around now, plotting starts to solidify for a hardware tuner.

### Sept 28, 2020

Wife orders 
[copper foil](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0042SWYUA) 
for the horn. I order the 
[USB microphone](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07VWJ1XB2) 
that will be connected to the Raspberry Pi 4 I have on hand.

### Sept 29, 2020

Orders for more power accessories:
[5V 25W power supply](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00DECXUD0), 
and a nice little 
[USB-C-to-terminal-block power adapter](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07R8YPFD7)
to power the Pi without having to jankily connect a cell phone charger on the
inside of the enclosure.

Ordered a handful of gauges, 5Vdc analogue, of various sizes:

[45mm](https://www.ebay.ca/itm/181981812727),
[66mm](https://www.ebay.ca/itm/183445575857)
and
[90mm](https://www.ebay.ca/itm/172695600128).

These are coming from China so I'm expecting it to take forever for them to 
get here, but anything in North America is exhorbitant. The intent is to 
replace the faceplate with a custom one and backlight it if possible.

Order some vintage-style electrical accessories from 
[Vintage Wire & Supply](https://vintagewireandsupply.com). They're relatively
expensive but look incredible.

Pictured above: temporary keyboard on the bottom; open box (so far unmodified) 
in the middle with the Raspberry Pi board sitting on top of it; USB microphone 
sticking out to the right. The ribbon cable is for a real-time clock that is 
also temporary. On the left you can see the twisted brown cotton vintage-style 
120VAC cord.

Pictured above: power components sitting in a temporary arrangement in the box. 
Far centre left is the brown 120VAC cord, running to a brass stress relief in 
the middle that will eventually be in the side of the box. Centre is a white 
marette to the switch. Lower left is the antique switch that will be mounted to 
the exterior of the box. Lower right is the MeanWell power supply; more rugged 
and well-ventilated than the typical cell phone charger. The red-yellow cord 
runs 5V from the power supply to a small green terminal block, in turn through a 
USB-C cable to the Raspberry Pi on the upper left.

### Oct 2, 2020

Going on vacation. The wife has let me bring a pile of tech goodies to work on 
this project.

### Oct 3, 2020

Using the same GitHub web page, resuscitate the tuner project, but with 
hardware in mind. The Raspberry Pi, keyboard, mouse, microphone and cell phone
power supply are set up on the coffee table of the cottage, and I have a great
time getting going on development.

### Oct 4, 2020

Start using the Simple Direct Layer for microphone capture on the Raspberry Pi.
Pretty much immediately throw that out the window in favour of the underlying
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.

### Oct 7, 2020

Research into the best way to detect pitch. Intend on running autocorrelation 
for note detection, in line with the
[findings of Coert Vonk](https://coertvonk.com/sw/embedded/arduino-pitch-detector-13252),
and associated research by
[Brown](http://academics.wellesley.edu/Physics/brown/pubs/acptrv89P2346-P2354.pdf)
and
[Monti](http://193.166.3.2/pub/sci/audio/dafx/2000/profs.sci.univr.it/%257Edafx/Final-Papers/pdf/Monti_DAFX00poster.pdf).

Some of it makes no sense to me so I post on a 
[Digital Signal Processing](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/70736)
forum.

Ordered some Microchip PIC16LF1773 (programmable interrupt controller) from 
Mouser, since DigiKey was nearly out of stock. These devices have a mix of 5- 
and 10-bit unbuffered DACs that can be internally buffered with three op-amps; 
they also support UART, I2C and SPI - so one way or the other they'll 
definitely be able to talk with the Pi.

### Oct 10, 2020

Start using the Gnu Scientific Library with the intent of applying it to the 
autocorrelation work.

### Oct 11, 2020

Throw GSL out the window in favour of ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra 
Software), an implementation of BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms).

### Oct 16, 2020

The gauges arrived from China, quicker than I expected! They're wonderful
little devices, fully disassemble-able with two screws on the side, and come
pre-packaged with hardware for the mounting bolts. There's a high-accuracy
resistor in each, and the input impedance is a little over 5k, so the PIC can
definitely handle it.

![Gauge sitting on a breadboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/gauge-on-board.jpg)

Upper left: chassis of the power supply; with the red PICkit 3 programmer in 
front of it, plugged into the breadboard.

The breadboard has the intended DAC PIC just below the PICkit.

On the gauge itself: the sticker on the top will be discarded; the front 
plastic pane and surrounding cylindrical cover come off with two screws on the 
side (not shown); then the instrument plate comes off with two bolts on the 
front.

### Oct 19, 2020

Start a PIC firmware project to act as a DAC (digital-to-analogue converter) 
for the Raspberry Pi.

### Oct 21, 2020

Start an Eagle schematic to plan out how the DAC will be connected.

### Oct 22, 2020

Parts I still need to dig up or buy:

- Amber LEDs for the gauge backlights
- Perfboard
- Rectangular cable to run from the Pi to header on the perfboard
- A rail-to-rail 0-5V buffer op-amp for the one remaining unbuffered DAC output

I also need to upgrade the Pi to a 64-bit operating system, since I didn't 
realize I had been using a deprecated 32-bit Raspbian.

Also need to write a calibration routine that gives me interquartile range for
the harmonics at various notes.

### Oct 23, 2020

Consider using a nice amber LED for backlights; such as the Lite-On LTL-1CHA with
- 3mm diffusion lens
- 20mA max, 2.1 volts forward
- 60¬∞ half-power angle
- Wavelengths: 602 nanometres dominant, 610 nanometres peak

If we use 10mA, we need 270R limiting each LED. For fade-in with a capacitor 
parallel to the LED, and a time constant over 2 seconds, we need a large 
capacitor of ~10mF.

### Oct 24, 2020

The capacitive fade-in option kind of sucks. The capacitors needed are big and 
expensive, and all four could be replaced with a single 40mA MOSFET driven by
PWM from the PIC. Another advantage of PWM would be that it works right away,
where as capacitive charge has to go through a dead zone where the forward 
voltage is below that needed by the LED.

The PIC16F1773 supports 10/16-bit hardware PWM with a bunch of different 
sources. PWMs 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 11 all support PPS and at least one of them can
output to each of PORTA/B/C, respectively. Compare/capture/PWM (CCP) modules
1, 2, and 7 likewise can output to at least one of those ports.

The hardware solution would have charged by

    V(t) Œ± 1 - exp(-t/ùúè)
    
with 90% by

    t = -ùúè ln(1 - 0.9)

If we want 90% in two seconds, ùúè ~ 0.8686, and our time expression becomes

    V(t) Œ± 1 - 0.1^(t/2)

A piecewise linear approximation would depend on the derivative:

    dV/dt = 1/ùúè exp(-t/ùúè)
          = -ln0.1 / 2 * 0.1^(t/2)
    
If we increment 8 of the 16 bits in the duty cycle for a PWM,
the configuration would be

    EN = 1
    MODE = 00 (standard)
    PRIE = 1 (interrupt on period match to update duty)
    PS set to divide between 2^0 and 2^7
    CS either HFINTOSC (16MHz) or LFINTOSC (31kHz) - both sleep-compatible
    OFM = 00 (independent run)

We will be starting DC at 0, DC delta at a high value, and applying a simple
binary exponential decay algorithm on the delta. To find the initial delta
value we need to work backward: at the end of the curve, the delta will only
be 1, representing 2^-8 of full deflection. The last intersection of the exact
and approximate curves is at

    -ùúè ln(2^-8) ~ 4.817 s
    
At this time, the derivative is

    1/ùúè * 2^-8 ~ 0.004497

The time it takes to increase 2^-8 is, with an initial tangent,

    2^-8 ùúè exp(t/ùúè)

which starts as 3.4 ms. If we only did this for one cycle, we could still have
a PWM rate of 295 Hz. Assuming a PR of 0x100, 

    Period = (PWMxPR + 1) * prescale / clock
    prescale = log(16e6 * 2^-8 ùúè / (2^8 + 1)) / log(2) ~ 7.72 > 7

The slowest prescale for 16-bit PWM is 2^7, which would mean a period value of

    2^-8 ùúè * 16e6 / 2^7 - 1 ~ 423 > 2^8

which would require carry operations during PWM update. If we go the other way,
disable the prescaler and use LFINTOSC=31kHz,

    2^-8 ùúè * 31e3 - 1 = 104

`TMR2IE` probably won't work in 10-bit mode, because the timer is cleared on
period match.

It's also worth noting that the transfer function for duty cycle to lumens is 
assumed to be linear but probably isn't.


### Oct 25, 2020

Some of the above will stay true and some won't. The problem with having a
fixed delta update rate is that eventually, the delta would need to be
fractional, and we're only using integer math.

This is a very powerful device; we could pursue any of the following as
alternatives:

- Use 16-bit PWM, interrupt on `PRIF`, increment a soft post-scaler,
  increment `PWMxDC` on post-scale overflow, double post-scale factor every
  140 `PRIF`s
- Use 10/16-bit PWM, short `PWMx` output to `TMR4_clk` input, increment 
  `PWMxDCH` on every `TMR4IF`, short `PWMx` output to `TMR6_clk` input, double 
  `PR4` on every `TMR6IF`
- Use CLC with two internal PWM/CCP inputs, offset by a beat frequency
- Use COG with two internal PCM/CCP inputs, offset by a beat frequency

For the last one, we'd have:

- `COG1CON0`
    - `EN` = 1
    - `CS` = 0b10 (HFINTOSC, sleep-compatible)
    - `MD` = 0b000 (steered PWM)
- `G1RIS9` = 1 (PWM5 for rising)
- `G1FIS10` = 1 (PWM6 for falling)
- `COG1STRA` = 1 (output on steering channel A)

### Oct 27, 2020

Continuing the silliness above, I've posted a 
[detailed solution](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/529533/10008).

### Nov 24, 2020

A month, more math and experimentation later, the LED fader is done. As it turns 
out, the luminosity transfer function seems to be visually exponential so I can 
get away with a linear ramp. 

![bright LED](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/led-fading.jpg)

The very bright red LED used in this test will not be used in the final system 
but is working fine nevertheless. This one is so bright that it illuminates my 
ceiling at 20mA.

### Nov 25, 2020

New parts ordered: 

- the protoboard where stuff will get soldered (though-hole only), 
- the nice amber LEDs, 
- some rectangular cables for SPI, and 
- some rail-to-rail operational amplifiers - only one is needed as a buffer for 
  a digital-to-analog converter output; the other outputs have buffers already.

### Nov 26, 2020

Did a rough layout of the digital-to-analog converter circuit as it will be on
the protoboard.

![Eagle protoboard layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/protoboard-eagle.png)

- Upper left: the power entry block
- Mid-left: the buffer chip "U2" for gauges. Only one of the two channels is 
  strictly necessary, but use both to offload a tiny bit more current from the 
  MCU and prevent floating.
- Centre: the MCU (microcontroller) "U1" that the Raspberry Pi will talk to, 
  with its SPI (serial port) "JS" on the bottom.
- Lower-right: gauge backlight PWM driving circuit, four-channel
- Upper-right: programming/debug connector "JD".

The red traces are copper on the board's top layer. The thin yellow lines are
ratsnest that I need to wire and solder myself.
